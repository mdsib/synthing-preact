** seems like waveEditor works by sending a new waveform array and getting that same thing back as a prop, then checking against the old one and seeing that it's different. Could this be better?
*** too many props change because of mousemove event bullshit
*** gotta always check in componentWillReceiveProps if we should compute or not since it isn't guaranteed that any props have changed.

** send mouse events through dom rather than react? Might cause conflicts with events down the line. But it would be more efficient

*** add mousemove listener only on click on canvas
*** remove on mouseup!
*** don't do until necessary
** the synth
*** whenever the wave changes, it should be put into the osc node
*** whenever settings in UI change, they should change the nodes related to those settings.
